<p>A UPI (Unified Payments Interface) Collect Description refers to the payment request sent by a merchant or user to another user, which the recipient then approves or declines in their UPI app. Unlike a UPI Pay request where the user sends money, a Collect request is a "pull" transaction where the recipient initiates the request and the sender pulls money from their account. </p>
